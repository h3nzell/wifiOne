      <p class="text-center story-text">
        wifiOne's journey began in 2015 as a passion project, driven by a desire to deliver exceptional WiFi solutions at accessible prices.
        <br>Founded by a team with extensive enterprise experience, we were acutely aware of the challenges businesses faced in achieving
        <br>reliable, high-performance WiFi. Determined to fill this gap, we embarked on a mission to develop robust and performant WiFi
        <br>solutions that "just work."<br>
        In 2019, wifiOne transitioned from a hobby project to a sole proprietorship, marking a significant step in our growth. Two years later, in
         2021, we incorporated, solidifying our commitment to providing enterprise-grade WiFi solutions to a wider audience.
        <br>
        Today, wifiOne stands as a boutique solution provider, specializing in delivering performant and secure managed WiFi and networks at
         an affordable price point.
